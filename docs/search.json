      "description": "Now that you are here to learn more about Hermosa Catoure, let me tell you exactly how we make our modest clothing, how well the quality is, and why it is so cheap. Firstly, all the fabric comes from all over the world and is handpicked specially from Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Spain, and Italy. These are the ranked fabric makers in the world. As well as we have many factories where the clothes are tailored and fit to your liking, as that is what couture means. We also make sure that everything is perfect and in place. As well as why we sell them for cheap is that modest clothing nowadays can be extremely expensive and not the best quality and most likely not very up to trend. Hermosa Couture also helps for people that might not be Muslim but still are trying to be modest. So now you have learned more about us, how about you go shopping?",
